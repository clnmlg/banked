## <a name="quick-start">Quick Start</a>

You want to give it a try? Two options for you :

**Try the demo version online (easiest way)**
If you want to sign-in you can navigate freely on the platform using these credentials :

```bash

- demo password : 123123234
```

**You can also create an account using the sign-up form**
_Please respect the fields mentionned in the forms. Like many bank apps and for security, filters are extremely sensible_

- Dwolla application has been made initially for the US market. For that reason, 'State' field must be a US country of two letters only. I'll apply a fix/switch to another providers for other customers ASAP.
- After filling the form, you'll need to choose a bank to connect to (select anyone as it is fake datas for now). After that, you'll need to enter these credentials :
